Lavenders are small evergreen shrubs with gray-green hoary linear leaves. The purple flowers are sparsely arranged on spikes at the tips of long bare stalks and produce small nutlet fruits. The fragrance of the plant is caused by shining oil glands imbedded among tiny star-shaped trichomes (plant hairs) that cover the flowers, leaves, and stems.

SUNFLOWER-
Sunflowers are tall annual or perennial plants that can reach a height of 300 cm (120 inches) in some varieties. To attract pollinators, each "flower" is actually a disc made up of small blooms. The plants produce one or more wide, terminal capitula (flower heads made up of numerous tiny flowers) with bright yellow ray florets (little flowers inside a flower head) on the outside and yellow or maroon disc florets on the interior. There are several decorative varieties of H. The ray florets of annuus are crimson. Petiolate leaves are dentate and frequently sticky. 
Lower leaves are either opposite, oval, or heart-shaped. In wild plants, the rough and hairy stem is branched in the upper part, but in domesticated cultivars, it is normally unbranched. Helianthus is differentiated technically by the sterility of the ray florets (when present) and the presence on the disc blooms of a pappus comprised of two caducous awn-like scales.

\\\

TULIP-

Tulip flowers are typically big, actinomorphic, hermaphrodite, upright, or pendulous, and arranged as a single terminal bloom or two to three blossoms on the end of a floriferous stem. The perianth is undifferentiated and biseriate, composed of six free (i.e., apotepalous) caducous tepals grouped in two independent whorls of three segments each. The tepals are normally petaloid and vividly colored, however, each whorl may be distinct or have various coloured blotches at their bases, resulting in deeper coloring on the interior surface. The inner petals feature a small, fragile split at the top, whilst the tougher outer petals form continuous ovals.
